## Mechatronics Project Fall-2017

The objective of this project is to design and implement a PID control for a Lego Mindstorms EV3 Unmanned Vehicle (UV) for different set of tasks. The Tasks laid out are namely:

1. Path Tracking: Implement a PID control for the UV to move from point A with coordinate (xA, yA) to Point B (xB, yB) as fast as possible by tracking a given path r;

1. Parking: Park as close as possible to the block (Point B) without touching it;

1. Platooning: Implement a PID control to regulate the UV speed to follow a moving UV in the front and maintain a constant distance.

The Report.pdf contains detailed discussion on how this was accomplished.
